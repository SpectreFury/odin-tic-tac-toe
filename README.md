# Odin Tic Tac Toe

It's a tic tae toe game made under the node section of The Odin Project.

1: Make gameBoard object, playerObject, a control flow object.

Problem:
I'm going to make a 3d array for possible conditions that may result in gameover and then run them over a function that checks if it's game over and return true if that's the check else return false.
